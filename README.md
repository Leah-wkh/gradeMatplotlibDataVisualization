# gradeMatplotlibDataVisualization
For this CodeCademy project I recreated examples of various methods of data visualization using Matplotlib. 

The example is a bar chart with error bars. This chart compares test averages by year.

The next chart I recreated is a side by side bar chart that shows the difference in the average test scores of students from two different middle schools.

The next chart is a stacked bar chart that shows a breakdown of As, Bs, Cs, Ds, and Fs recieved by students in each unit.
